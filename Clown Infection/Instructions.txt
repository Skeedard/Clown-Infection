Instructions:

1. Use the file explorer to drag the ClownInfectionGamelogic and ClownInfectionPlayerProxy 
to your UGC folder in your Pavlov project, then add the gamelogic to the map and link the 
player proxy in the gamelogic.

2. Edit the configuration variables to your liking, but make sure to keep balancing in mind, 
100hp clowns will be at a severe disadvantage if the survivors are given assault rifles.

3. If anything is added to the infected powerups list (ie special items or the TTT phone teleporter),
make sure to add them to the allowed clown items list in the player proxy variables.

4. To edit special rounds, change the items spawned via the weapon spawns tab in the 
gamelogic, or set the special round chance to 0 to disable them.

5. That is all information needed. If you need help with clown infection specific problem, 
ping Skeedard#3181 in the Pavlov Discord infected channel and specify what you need help with.
