Instructions:

1. Unzip project and generate a new UGC folder in the project, then move the "move this into the UGC folder" folder
into your new UGC folder. If you have a map in another project you'd like to use, migrate it into this new project.
Drag the ClownInfectionGameLogic into your map instead of the Pavlov game logic, and make sure to select ClownInfectionPlayerProxy
for the player proxy.

2. Edit the configuration variables to your liking, but make sure to keep balancing in mind, 
100hp clowns will be at a severe disadvantage if the survivors are given assault rifles.

3. If anything is added to the infected powerups list (ie special items or the TTT phone teleporter),
make sure to add them to the allowed clown items list in the player proxy variables.

4. To edit special rounds, change the items spawned via the weapon spawns tab in the 
gamelogic, or set the special round chance to 0 to disable them.

5. That is all information needed. If you need help with clown infection specific problem, 
ping Skeedard#3181 in the Pavlov Discord infected channel and specify what you need help with.
